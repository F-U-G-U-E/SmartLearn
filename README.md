# SmartLearn

This is a scraper of learn2018.tsinghua.edu.cn

The new 2018 Web Learning (网络学堂), in my opinion, is full of garbage informations, which significantly decreases the info density and increases the time we waste on it. So I wrote a scraper. 

Before using, please change the username and password in line 69 ~ 70. 

Code is for Chrome ... Install Chrome and Chromedriver before use. And change the path in line 61 to the path of your Chromedriver. Be careful of the whether they are compatible. 

Safari may works ... If you disable line 58, 59, 61 (setting of Chrome) and enable line 60 (use Safari). 

Decreasing the sleep time at line 88 could obviously reduce our waiting time. But sufficient sleep time is essential for the webpage loading process ... So you may change it but plz don't delete it. 

There must be a lot of problems I think ...
